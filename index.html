        Through the maze of time, soft voices call, Echoes gather along this
        ancient hall.
        <br /><br />
        Some words grow rich, thick with meaning's wine, Others turn sour, edge
        sharp with time.
        <br /><br />
        Now, one philosopher steps into the gleam— Will their speech shape
        dreams or shatter the dream?
