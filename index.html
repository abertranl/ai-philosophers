      <h1>The timeless debate</h1>
      <h2>
        Through the maze of time, soft voices call,
        <br />
        Echoes gather along this ancient home.
        <br /><br />
        Some words grow rich, thick with meaning's wine,
        <br />
        Others turn sour, edge sharp with time.
        <br /><br />
        A philosopher steps into the gleam—
        <br />
        Will their speech shape dreams or shatter the dream?

          Immanuel Kant revolutionized philosophy by arguing that our knowledge
          is shaped by the way our minds structure experience. He made a key
          distinction between phenomena (the world as we perceive it) and
          noumena (things-in-themselves which we can never fully know).
          Morality, for Kant, is grounded in the "categorical imperative," a
          universal principle urging us to act only by rules that could apply to
          everyone, and to always treat people as ends in themselves, never as
          means. He insisted that reason, freedom, and autonomy are the
          foundation of ethical behavior. Kant’s work wrestles with the limits
          of knowledge, the sovereignty of rational will, and the hope for moral
          progress.

          Oh Kant, sweet Kant, architect of mental filters and universal rules.
          You said we can never know things as they really are—brutal, right?
          Like, everything is a colorful Snapchat filter our brain throws on
          reality. But don’t get me wrong, I’m with you on the moral law—no
          stealing your friend’s wifi or ghosting without explanation because it
          wouldn’t make a good universal rule. Still, tying ethics so tightly to
          abstract reason? Feels like an overachieving science fair project of
          the mind, super neat but missing all the messy, weird, emotional vibes
          that make us human. Maybe your categorical imperative could chill a
          bit and stop acting like a strict Gen Z TikTok rule-maker. But hey,
          thanks for giving autonomy a glow-up before it was cool.
